## Git

We use Git as our main VCS in the project. We follow "Conventional Commits"(https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style guide for commit messages. This will help to understand the initial meanings of commits and their descriptions without any difficulties. 

## C++

We use C++17 as our main programming language in the project. For each implemented functionality there should be provided both unit tests and integrational tests. 

## Pull requests

For each change in the project there should be created "pull request"(PR in short). We have CI/CD pipeline built specially for PRs. It runs all local tests and then, if though any tests doesn't pass, it blocks the opportunity to merge your changes. Such approach increases the quality of the code.
